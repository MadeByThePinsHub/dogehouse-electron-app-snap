grade: devel

# Chnage this into strict once the essentials are added
confinement: devmode

# Ensure that keep things up-to-date with the latest LTS as possible

# into core18 until they support Core 20 finally.
base: core18

# No 32-bit (i386) support as per git-branch:new-design:
# baklava/package.json scripts, but let's try if it's works.
