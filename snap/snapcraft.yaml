# Since we're still testing the Electron app, we'll go into
# the edge/devel channel.
grade: devel

# Chnage this into strict once the essentials are added
confinement: devmode

# Ensure that keep things up-to-date with the latest LTS as possible
# but since Gnome 3.x wants Ububtu Core 18, we need to change that
# into core18 until they support Core 20 finally.
base: core18

# No 32-bit (i386) support as per git-branch:staging:
# baklava/package.json scripts. And also I don't like to
# mess up with arm64 again.
architectures:
  - build-on: amd64
    run-on: amd64
  #- build-on: arm64
  #  run-on: arm64

# WORK IN PROGRESS / PLEASE PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK
# Sidenote: This was copied from https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/snapcraft#step-1-create-sample-snapcraft-project
# and requires additional work and testing.
